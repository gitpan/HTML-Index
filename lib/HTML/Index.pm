HTML::Index - Perl modules for creating and searching an index of HTML files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use HTML::Index::Store;
  
    $indexer = HTML::Index::Store->new(
        STOP_WORD_FILE      => '/path/to/stopword/file',
        DB                  => '/path/to/db/directory',
        COMPRESS            => 1,
        REFRESH             => 0,
        PARSER              => 'HTML',
    );

    for ( ... )
    {
        my $doc = HTML::Index::Document->new( 
            name        => $name,
            contents    => $contents,
            mod_time    => $mod_time,
        );
        $indexer->index_document( $doc );
    }

    for ( ... )
    {
        my $doc = HTML::Index::Document->new( path => $path );
        # name, contents, and mod_time are the path, contents and modification
        # time of $path
        $indexer->index_document( $doc );
    }

    my $search = HTML::Index::Store->new( DB_DIR => $db_dir );
    my @results = $search->search( $q );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTML::Index is a set of modules for creating an index of HTML documents so that
they can be subsequently searched by keywords, or by Boolean combinations of
keywords. It was originally inspired by indexer.pl script in the O'Reilly "CGI
Programming with Perl, 2nd Edition" book
(L<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cgi2/author.html>).

All storage operations are contained in the HTML::Index::Store module that can
be subclassed to support other storage options (such as BerkeleyDB files, or
SQL databases). Two such subclasses (HTML::Index::Store::BerkeleyBD and
HTML::Index::DataDumper) are included in the distribution.

The modules can be used to index any HTML documents - whether stored as files,
or in a database. They support the use of stopword lists, soundex searches,
compression of the inverted indexes and re-indexing of documents. Search
queries can be expressed as compound Boolean expressions, composed of keywords,
parentheses, and logical operators (OR, AND, NOT).
