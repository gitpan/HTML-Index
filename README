HTML::Index
===========

Description
-----------

HTML::Index is a set of modules for creating an index of HTML documents so that
they can be subsequently searched by keywords, or by Boolean combinations of
keywords. It was originally inspired by indexer.pl script in the O'Reilly "CGI
Programming with Perl, 2nd Edition" book
(http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cgi2/author.html).

All storage operations are contained in the HTML::Index::Store module that can
be subclassed to support other storage options (such as BerkeleyDB files, or
SQL databases). Two such subclasses (HTML::Index::Store::BerkeleyBD and
HTML::Index::DataDumper) are included in the distribution.

The modules can be used to index any HTML documents - whether stored as
files, or in a database. They support the use of stopword lists, soundex
searches, compression of the inverted indexes using Compress::Zlib, and
re-indexing of documents that have changed.  Search queries can be expressed as
compound Boolean expressions, composed of keywords, parentheses, and logical
operators (OR, AND, NOT).
